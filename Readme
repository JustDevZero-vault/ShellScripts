This repository will be full of scripts made in zsh, sh, or even bash.

Massuploader.zsh: [ZSH] This script uploads massively files in your current directory (or your desired directory) to megaupload, using plowshare files.

THIS IS USELESS NOW THANKS TO THE FBI. MEGAUPLOAD HAS SHUTTED DOWN!

NO SOPA! NO ACTA! NO SINDE-WERD!
